# Architecture: Claude - Docling API Wrapper

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.12+**: Main programming language
- **FastAPI**: Web framework for building the REST API
- **Docling**: IBM's document processing library for converting documents to Markdown
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **uv**: Package manager for dependency management and script execution

### Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container orchestration for local development and production
- **OpenTelemetry (OTEL)**: Observability framework for traces and metrics
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection (via OTEL)

## Architecture Decisions

### API Design
- RESTful API design with JSON request/response format
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - API layer (request handling, validation, response formatting)
  - Service layer (business logic, document processing)
  - Infrastructure layer (observability, configuration)
- Stateless design for horizontal scalability

### Document Processing
- Asynchronous processing for improved performance
- Temporary file storage for document processing
- Stream processing where possible to minimize memory usage
- Proper cleanup of temporary files after processing

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Graceful degradation when possible

### Observability
- OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- Health check endpoint for system status

## Technical Debt

### Current Technical Debt
- No automated tests implemented yet
- Basic error handling needs to be expanded
- Documentation is minimal
- No CI/CD pipeline configured

### Future Considerations
- Performance optimization for large documents
- Caching mechanism for frequently accessed documents
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Authentication and authorization
- Support for additional document formats

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local Docker Compose setup with hot reloading
- Local OpenTelemetry collector for development

### Production Environment
- Docker container deployment
- External OpenTelemetry collector
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Proper resource limits and scaling

## Data Flow

1. Client sends document URL or content to API
2. API validates request and fetches document if needed
3. Document is processed by Docling library
4. Markdown output is generated and returned to client
5. Metrics and traces are collected throughout the process

## Security Considerations

- Input validation to prevent malicious content
- Resource limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Secure handling of temporary files
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage
