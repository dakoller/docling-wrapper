# Current Task: Project Setup and Core API Implementation

## Current Objectives
- ✅ Set up the basic project structure for the Claude - Docling API Wrapper
- ✅ Configure the development environment with necessary dependencies
- ✅ Implement the core API functionality (Phase 1 from projectRoadmap.md)

## Context
The project has completed its initial setup phase. We have implemented the basic functionality for converting HTML to Markdown, both from URLs and raw HTML content. The PDF conversion functionality is planned for future implementation.

We have:
1. ✅ Updated the pyproject.toml file with the necessary dependencies
2. ✅ Created the basic FastAPI application structure
3. ✅ Created a mock implementation of the Docling library
4. ✅ Implemented the essential API endpoints
5. ✅ Set up Docker containerization
6. ✅ Set up OpenTelemetry for observability
7. ✅ Created test files and scripts for local and Docker testing

## Completed Steps

### 1. Project Dependencies
- ✅ Updated pyproject.toml with all required dependencies
- ✅ Added development dependencies for testing and code quality

### 2. Application Structure
- ✅ Created src directory with main application files
- ✅ Set up FastAPI application with basic configuration
- ✅ Defined API routes and models

### 3. Core Endpoints
- ✅ Implemented `/convert` endpoint for document conversion
- ✅ Implemented `/health` endpoint for health checks
- ✅ Set up basic error handling

### 4. Docker Setup
- ✅ Created Dockerfile
- ✅ Created docker-compose.yml for local development
- ✅ Added OpenTelemetry collector configuration
- ✅ Created scripts for running locally and with Docker

### 5. Document Processing
- ✅ Created mock implementation of Docling library
- ✅ Implemented HTML URL processing functionality
- ✅ Implemented HTML source processing functionality
- ✅ Created test files for verification

## Next Steps

### 1. Implement PDF Processing
- Implement PDF URL processing functionality
- Implement PDF file processing functionality
- Add tests for PDF conversion

### 2. Enhance Error Handling
- Implement more comprehensive error handling
- Add validation for input parameters
- Improve error messages and logging

### 3. Improve Observability
- Enhance OpenTelemetry integration
- Add more metrics and traces
- Implement structured logging

### 4. Add Authentication and Security
- Implement API key authentication
- Add rate limiting
- Implement input validation for security
