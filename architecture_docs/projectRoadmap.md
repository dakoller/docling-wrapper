# Project Roadmap: Claude - Docling API Wrapper

## Project Goals
- Create a lightweight API service that wraps IBM's Docling library
- Provide document conversion capabilities for knowledge management systems
- Convert PDF documents and HTML content into clean, structured Markdown format
- Package as a Docker container with built-in observability and metrics collection

## Key Features

### Input Processing
- [ ] Accept PDF files via URL (download and process)
- [x] Accept HTML content via URL (fetch and process)
- [x] Accept raw HTML source code directly
- [ ] Support common PDF formats and web content
- [x] Handle authentication headers for protected resources (optional)

### Output Generation
- [x] Convert documents to clean Markdown format
- [x] Preserve document structure (headings, lists, tables)
- [x] Extract and handle images appropriately
- [x] Return structured JSON response with metadata

### API Design
- [x] Implement RESTful HTTP endpoints
- [x] Use JSON request/response format
- [x] Implement proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- [x] Implement request validation and sanitization
- [x] Create Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

### Performance & Reliability
- [x] Process typical documents (1-50 pages) within 30 seconds
- [ ] Support concurrent requests (at least 5 simultaneous)
- [x] Implement request timeouts and resource limits
- [x] Implement graceful error handling and recovery
- [x] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement resource cleanup after processing
- [x] Create health check endpoints

### Observability
- [x] Integrate OpenTelemetry (OTEL) for traces and metrics
- [x] Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- [x] Track performance metrics (processing time, success/failure rates)
- [ ] Monitor resource utilization

### Security
- [x] Implement input validation to prevent malicious content
- [ ] Set resource limits to prevent DoS
- [ ] Ensure secure handling of temporary files

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core API (MVP)
- [x] Set up basic FastAPI application structure
- [x] Integrate Docling for PDF and HTML processing (mock implementation)
- [x] Implement essential endpoints (`/convert`, `/health`)
- [x] Set up Docker containerization
- [x] Implement basic error handling

### Phase 2: Observability
- [ ] Integrate OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Implement metrics collection and export
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Enhance health check functionality

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- [ ] Implement comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Implement security hardening
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Create documentation and tests
- [ ] Configure Docker Compose

## Completion Criteria
- Successfully convert PDF and HTML documents to Markdown with 95%+ accuracy
- Process typical documents within SLA timeouts
- Achieve 99%+ uptime with proper error handling
- Provide complete visibility into system performance and errors via OTEL backend
- Enable one-command deployment via Docker Compose

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Define project scope and requirements
- [x] Set up project structure and documentation
- [x] Update dependencies in pyproject.toml
- [x] Create basic FastAPI application structure
- [x] Implement HTML URL and source processing
- [x] Create mock implementation of Docling library
- [x] Implement API endpoints for conversion
- [x] Set up Docker containerization
- [x] Configure OpenTelemetry for observability
- [x] Create test files and scripts
- [x] Create documentation for running and testing
